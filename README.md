> **Aura** is a production-grade macOS application that pairs immersive, layered soundscapes with dynamic desktop wallpapers to elevate user focus, relaxation, and productivity. Built natively for macOS using the latest Apple platform design guidelines, Aura envelops your workspace in a stunning **Liquid Glass** aesthetic.

## ✨ Features

### 🌊 Liquid Glass Interface
Experience a beautifully crafted, translucent user interface. Aura deeply integrates with macOS 16+ `glassEffect` APIs to provide an adaptive, frosted-glass look that bleeds your desktop environment into the app controls seamlessly.

### 🎧 Ambient Sound Mixer
Sculpt your perfect audio environment. Mix and match individual audio layers with precision:
- 🌧️ **Rain & Storms**
- 🍃 **Forest & Wind**
- ☕ **Cafe Ambience**
- 🌊 **Ocean Waves & Streams**
- 📻 **Brown Noise & Hum**

### 🖼️ Dynamic Wallpapers
Transform your desktop background based on your current mood:
- **Dynamic Wallpapers:** High-definition video loops that shift throughout the day, providing a living backdrop to your workspace.
- **Image Playground Integration:** Seamlessly use Apple's Image Playground to generate custom, AI-powered backgrounds.
- **Atmospheric Soundscapes:** Layered audio environments featuring rain, forest sounds, cafe ambience, and white noise.

### ⚡ Command Palette & Menu Bar
Stay in the flow. Hit `⌘K` to instantly search and switch moods, or access quick controls from the unobtrusive Menu Bar popover.

## 🛠️ Architecture

Aura is built on a robust, modern Swift architecture utilizing strict concurrency (`@MainActor`), `@Observable` state management, and decoupled engine services:

- **`AppModel`**: The central nervous system and dependency injection container.
- **`MoodEngine`**: Manages the catalog of built-in and user-generated moods.
- **`WallpaperEngine`**: Handles seamless transitions between `AVPlayerView`, `NSViewRepresentable` WebViews, and native SwiftUI generative art.
- **`SoundEngine`**: Powered by `AVAudioEngine` for gapless looping and crossfading of multi-channel audio layers.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **macOS 16.0** or later.
- **Xcode 16+** with Swift 6 support.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Aura.git
   ```
2. Open `Aura.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. Select the **Aura** scheme and target your Mac.
4. Hit `⌘R` to build and run.
